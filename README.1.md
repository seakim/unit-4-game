# selfchallenge1

A quick new project to challenge myself with responsive CSS

## How to install

navigate to where the project was installed

type `npm install` into the console (This will install this projects dependencies, ignore any security warnings for now, this isn't a production server so it will not expose your computer or data so long as you have a good firewall)

type `npm install -g node-sass gulp gulp-sass` into the console (This will install the developer's dependencies on a global scope)



create a new repository on the command line
    echo "# musicPlayer" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:seakim/musicPlayer.git
    git push -u origin master
â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
    git remote add origin git@github.com:seakim/musicPlayer.git
    git push -u origin master
